# IoT-Auth.-Project

The topology basically consists of three nodes: client, Authorization server and the gateway and when some data is acquired from the network, the gateway will update its database with the new data. So, when a client requests some records from the gateway then the Authorization server will firstly generate a token and deliver it to the client, the client then on receiving the token, forwards it to the gateway in order to get the required data. As the token was created by the Authorization server, it was also signed at the same time so when the gateway receives it, it becomes easy for the gateway to validate the token. On complete verification, the gateway fulfills the request that was made by the client and if the verification was unsuccessful then the request is not fulfilled. We will want to work on building the connection between the three nodes in order to check the working of the framework. The main focus of the framework is to authenticate the client by verifying the token that was generated by the Authorization server with the one that the gateway receives from the client in order to get access to the resources.
